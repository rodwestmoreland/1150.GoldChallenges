## Purpose and Usage
### Cafe Menu Editor
This application gives an employee an easy way to view and modify items on the cafe's menu. There are three options available to the user: 1) View all current items, including a menu ID number; 2) Add a menu item including price and ingredients; 3) Remove an item by referencing the meal's ID number.

### Insurance Statistics
This application displays certain 2017-2019 insurance data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. This data can be helpful in forming a new pricing structure for offering incententives to clients who are considering purchasing an electric or hybrid vehicle. There are over 150 vehicles loaded, but more vehicles can be added, along with average data in the following categories: Collision, Comprehensive, and Personal Injury. Vehicles can be udated and deleted as needed.

### Email Notification Manager
Komodo had a request to keep categorize customers by length of time as a client. If the client had not requested services from Komodo for a certain period of time, then set an email body message to offer them an incentive to do business again. For current clients, a thank you message would be produced.  Contacts who have not yet become a client of Komodo would receive an email body containing special offers. Users can view all contacts and their status on the View All Contacts selection. Contacts can be added, updated and deleted as well.
